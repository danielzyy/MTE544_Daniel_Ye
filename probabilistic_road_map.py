Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) Planner

This version of the PRM implementation creates a connected graph by creating N_SAMPLES random samples in the free space,
then each sample is connected to max N_KNN neighbors, with a maximum distance of MAX_EDGE_LEN.
The PRM is implemented as follows:
- Parameters that need to be set:
  - N_SAMPLE = number of samples to create in the free space
  - N_KNN = number of neighbors to connect from each sample
  - MAX_EDGE_LEN = maximum distance for creating an edge between two samples
- Sample points are creates with the generate_sample_points function. The samples are randomly created in the free space,
  based on the list of obstacles, and the dimension of the robot. The samples should be at least radius of the robot distance away from any obstacles. 
- Create the roadmap using the generated sample_points, with the generate_road_map function. The roadmap is generated by looping
  over all samples. For each sample, N_KNN edges are created with neighboring samples. In creating the edge, a collision is checked with
  the is_collision function, to create edges that are not overlaying on obstacles. To introduce further control, a MAX_EDGE_LEN is imposed
  so that connected samples (nodes) are not too far from each other.

This code can run standalone without being integrated into the stack with control and navigation: python probabilistic_road_map.py
To do so, set use_map to False. This will help debugging your PRM implementation. It will use the obstacles list, start, and goal 
set in the main function.

Once it is integrated into the stack, set use_map to True and run everything from decisions.py as you have done in the labs.
